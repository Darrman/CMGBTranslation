YU-GI-OH: MONSTER CAPSULE GB
or YU-GI-OH: CAPSULE MONSTERS GB
ENGLISH FAN TRANSLATION v0.1

This patch translates the menus of the aforementioned game.
Please note that attack names and key items have simple placeholder names of
"Attack" and "Item" respectively,
with the former having a number added to the end.
Story dialogue has not been touched.
Due to technical limitations some menu items are heavily abbreviated.

Apply patch to Japanese rom.

Credits:
All work thus far is by Darrman.

Notes:
With the game being based on the Monster World arc of the manga and its anime
appearance being within "Season 0", the Toei show, I've used the English
manga names for the monsters.
In other words, it's largely still the 4kids names but a few monsters use
Japanese names instead.
This includes all the Capsule Monsters that aren't Duel Monsters. 
The character figurines use dub names: in other words, Tea instead of Anzu.

This patch is very much a work in progress.
This is a preliminary release.
I do not grant permission at the present time to make derivative works,
though when version 1.0 is released permission will be freely granted then.

Do not enquire about terminology choices or release dates.
Otherwise, feel free.
